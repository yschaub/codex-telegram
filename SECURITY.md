# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | Current development |

## Security Model

The Codex Code Telegram Bot implements a defense-in-depth security model with multiple layers:

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **User Whitelist**: Only pre-approved Telegram user IDs can access the bot
- **Token-Based Auth**: Optional token-based authentication for additional security
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling with timeout and cleanup

### 2. Directory Boundaries
- **Approved Directory**: All operations confined to a pre-configured directory tree
- **Path Validation**: Prevents directory traversal attacks (../../../etc/passwd)
- **Permission Checks**: Validates file system permissions before operations

### 3. Input Validation
- **Command Sanitization**: All user inputs sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- **File Type Validation**: Only allowed file types can be uploaded
- **Path Sanitization**: Removes dangerous characters and patterns (`;`, `&&`, `$()`, `..`)
- **Secret File Protection**: Blocks access to `.env`, `.ssh`, `id_rsa`, `.pem` files

### 4. Rate Limiting
- **Request Rate Limiting**: Token bucket algorithm prevents abuse with configurable limits
- **Cost-Based Limiting**: Tracks and limits Codex usage costs per user
- **Burst Protection**: Configurable burst capacity prevents spike attacks

### 5. Audit Logging
- **Authentication Events**: All login attempts and auth failures logged
- **Command Execution**: All commands and file operations logged
- **Security Violations**: Path traversal attempts, injection attempts, and other violations logged
- **Risk Assessment**: Automatic severity classification for security events

### 6. Webhook Authentication
- **GitHub HMAC-SHA256**: Webhook payloads verified against `X-Hub-Signature-256` header using a shared secret
- **Generic Bearer Token**: Non-GitHub providers authenticated via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- **Deduplication**: Atomic `INSERT OR IGNORE` on delivery ID prevents replay attacks
- **Event Security Middleware**: Validates webhook events before handler processing

## Current Security Status

All planned security features are implemented and active:

- Multi-provider authentication system (whitelist + token)
- Rate limiting with token bucket algorithm (request and cost-based)
- Input validation with path traversal, command injection, and zip bomb protection
- Directory isolation with approved directory boundaries
- Security audit logging with risk assessment and event tracking
- Bot middleware framework (auth, rate limit, security, burst protection)
- Webhook signature verification (GitHub HMAC-SHA256, generic Bearer token)
- Event security middleware for webhook and scheduled event validation
- Configuration security via Pydantic validators and SecretStr

## Security Configuration

### Required Security Settings

```bash
# Base directory for all operations (CRITICAL)
APPROVED_DIRECTORY=/path/to/approved/projects

# User access control
ALLOWED_USERS=123456789,987654321  # Telegram user IDs

# Optional: Token-based authentication
ENABLE_TOKEN_AUTH=true
AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET=your-secret-here  # Generate with: openssl rand -hex 32
```

### Webhook Security Settings

```bash
# GitHub webhook signature verification
GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-github-webhook-secret

# Generic webhook Bearer token
WEBHOOK_API_SECRET=your-api-secret

# API server (required for webhooks)
ENABLE_API_SERVER=true
API_SERVER_PORT=8080
```

### Recommended Security Settings

```bash
# Strict rate limiting for production
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=5
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=60
RATE_LIMIT_BURST=10

# Cost controls
CODEX_MAX_COST_PER_USER=5.0

# Security features
ENABLE_TELEMETRY=true  # For security monitoring
LOG_LEVEL=INFO         # Capture security events

# Environment
ENVIRONMENT=production  # Enables strict security defaults
```

## Security Best Practices

### For Administrators

1. **Directory Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Use minimal necessary permissions
   chmod 755 /path/to/approved/projects

   # Avoid sensitive directories
   # Don't use: /, /home, /etc, /var
   # Use: /home/user/projects, /opt/bot-projects
   ```

2. **Token Management**
   ```bash
   # Generate secure secrets
   openssl rand -hex 32

   # Store in environment, never in code
   export AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET="generated-secret"
   export GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET="generated-secret"
   export WEBHOOK_API_SECRET="generated-secret"
   ```

3. **User Management**
   ```bash
   # Get Telegram User ID: message @userinfobot
   # Add to whitelist
   export ALLOWED_USERS="123456789,987654321"
   ```

4. **Monitoring**
   ```bash
   # Enable logging and monitoring
   export LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   export ENABLE_TELEMETRY=true

   # Monitor logs for security events
   tail -f bot.log | grep -i "security\|auth\|violation"
   ```

### For Developers

1. **Never Commit Secrets** -- use `.gitignore` for `.env`, `*.key`, `*.pem`
2. **Use Type Safety** -- all functions must have type hints (`mypy --strict`)
3. **Validate All Inputs** -- use `SecurityValidator` for user-provided paths and commands
4. **Log Security Events** -- use structlog with `violation_type` and `user_id` context

## Threat Model

### Threats We Protect Against

1. **Directory Traversal** (High Priority) -- path traversal, symlink attacks
2. **Command Injection** (High Priority) -- shell injection, env var injection
3. **Unauthorized Access** (Medium Priority) -- non-whitelisted users, token replay
4. **Resource Abuse** (Medium Priority) -- rate limit bypass, cost limit violations
5. **Webhook Forgery** (Medium Priority) -- unsigned payloads, replay attacks
6. **Information Disclosure** (Low Priority) -- sensitive file exposure, error leakage

### Threats Outside Scope

- Network-level attacks (handled by hosting infrastructure)
- Telegram API vulnerabilities (handled by Telegram)
- Host OS security (handled by system administration)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not create public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.**

For security issues, please email: [Insert security contact email]

Include: description, steps to reproduce, potential impact, and suggested mitigation.

### Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment** within 48 hours
2. **Initial assessment** within 1 week
3. **Fix development** as soon as possible
4. **Security advisory** published after fix
